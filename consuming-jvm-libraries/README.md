1. Add dependency
2. Run `gradlew build`, it will generate ready for use distribution of an app inside build/distributions
3. Application plugin gives us useful `installDist` task which installs distribution inside build/install 
4. We can go then to build/install/\<app name\>/bin and run our app [in this case `consuming-jvm-libraries <args>`]
